## Donate
Developing, documenting and testing the UNICORN Binance Suite and supporting the community takes a lot of time and time 
is a form of cost. I am extremely happy to do this, but need a solution for sharing the costs.

I think we are lucky, as our community consists of traders and programmers I expect to find mostly rational thinking 
people who also benefit financially from these libraries.

I would like to create a fair model for funding. My goals are that unicorn-binance-websocket-api, 
unicorn-binance-rest-api and unicorn-fy remain freely available as open source and that I am compensated at least to 
some extent and thus can invest my time more easily.

If you know the hooker principle from negotiation research or game theory, you know about the problem that people don't 
often pay for something out of their own impulse if they have already received it for free. 

So my idea is to give every donor who gives an amount over 50 EUR access to a private Github repository where Python 
classes for trading algos are provided (OrderBook, advanced stop-loss, ...). Moreover, maybe a nice ApiTrader community 
will be formed.

So the donor not only helps to push the open source development but also gets access to a well maintained collection of 
practical code for little money. 

Furthermore community members can help me by donating own developments to make the 
[unicorn-coding-club](https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/unicorn-coding-club) repository more attractive to create 
further incentives for new donors. This way we generate added value for all sides in an uncomplicated way.

If you donated at least 50 EUR (without transaction fee), please send me a message with a confirmation and your Github 
username via https://www.lucit-development.co/contact.html, I will invite you to the 
[unicorn-coding-club](https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/unicorn-coding-club) as soon as possible.
